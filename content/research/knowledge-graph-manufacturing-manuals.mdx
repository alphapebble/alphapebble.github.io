**Problem Statement:** Manufacturing organizations struggle to manage and access complex manuals, technical documentation, and process instructions spread across multiple systems and formats. This fragmentation leads to costly errors, slow onboarding, and operational inefficiencies.

**Approach:** We designed and implemented a knowledge graph architecture that unifies disparate manufacturing manuals, technical documents, and process guides. The system enables dynamic, personalized access for engineers, operators, and managersâ€”mapping documentation to specific equipment, tasks, and user roles.

**Impact:** Our graph-based solution reduced search and retrieval time by 60%, improved compliance with operational procedures, and accelerated onboarding for new staff. By connecting documentation to real-world workflows, we unlocked measurable value and empowered teams to solve problems faster, with fewer mistakes.
