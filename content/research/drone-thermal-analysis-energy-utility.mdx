**Problem:**
Manual hotspot detection across energy infrastructure missed critical defects and ESG compliance risks. Traditional methods were slow, error-prone, and unable to process large volumes of thermal imagery, leading to delayed repairs and regulatory challenges.

**Approach:**
We deployed an AI-powered drone thermal analysis system capable of processing 300GB+ datasets in under an hour. The solution used advanced computer vision models to automatically detect hotspots, defects, and compliance issues, providing actionable insights to field teams and ESG managers.

**Impact:**
Achieved 92% mAP accuracy in defect detection, enabling 20% faster ESG resolutions and saving over $100K in operational costs. The client improved infrastructure reliability, reduced manual labor, and met ESG targets more efficiently.
