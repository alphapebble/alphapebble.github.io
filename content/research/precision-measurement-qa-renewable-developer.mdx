Manual verification of critical measurements (pile heights, pitch angles, pile-to-pile distances) across large-scale sites was labor-intensive and error-prone with strict tolerance requirements. PointNet++ model achieved 95% accuracy on diverse measurement tasks, reducing QA time from days to hours and saving $200K in rework across multiple measurement types.
