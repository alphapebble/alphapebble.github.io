**Problem:**
Manual verification of critical measurements (pile heights, pitch angles, pile-to-pile distances) across large-scale renewable sites was labor-intensive, error-prone, and struggled to meet strict tolerance requirements. Delays and inaccuracies led to costly rework and project risks.

**Approach:**
We deployed an AI-driven QA workflow using PointNet++ deep learning models to automate precision measurement tasks. The system processed point cloud data from site scans, accurately measuring and validating key parameters. Automated reports flagged out-of-tolerance measurements and provided actionable insights for field teams.

**Impact:**
Achieved 95% accuracy on diverse measurement tasks, reducing QA time from days to hours and saving $200K in rework across multiple measurement types. Renewable developers improved project quality, reduced manual labor, and delivered faster, more reliable site verification.
