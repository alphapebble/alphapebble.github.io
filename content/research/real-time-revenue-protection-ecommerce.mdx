**Problem Statement:** Shopify configurations and tracking errors disrupted data flow, leading to significant traffic drops, broken customer journeys, missing pixels, and revenue leakage. Manual detection proved insufficient to prevent substantial performance impact, delaying actionable insights for weeks.

**Approach:** We deployed an LSTM-based monitoring system to continuously track data flows and detect anomalies in real time. The system integrated with Shopify and analytics platforms, automatically flagging issues and providing actionable alerts to the operations team.

**Impact:** Our LSTM monitoring cut issue detection time by 95% (from weeks to hours), delivering measurable ROI within weeks. This immediate execution reduced Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) by 25%, and saved $2M in ad costs through enhanced conversion tracking, prioritizing profit over presentations. The client saw improved conversion rates, reduced wasted ad spend, and a more resilient eCommerce infrastructure.
