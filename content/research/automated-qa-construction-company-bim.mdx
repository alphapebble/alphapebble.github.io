**Problem:**
Manual 'as-built' vs. BIM (Building Information Modeling) comparisons were slow, error-prone, and often missed critical misalignments. Construction teams struggled to validate site progress against digital models, leading to costly rework and project delays.

**Approach:**
We implemented an automated QA workflow using advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques. Point cloud registration was performed with Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithms, and Random Forest models were used to classify and detect deviations between as-built scans and BIM models. The system generated detailed reports in hours instead of days, highlighting misalignments and compliance issues for rapid resolution.

**Impact:**
The AI-powered solution caught critical misalignments early, saving $250K in rework costs and reducing QA turnaround time by 80%. Construction teams improved project delivery, reduced manual labor, and achieved higher compliance with BIM standards.
