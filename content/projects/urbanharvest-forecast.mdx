UrbanHarvest, an innovative D2C grocery service, faced a classic startup dilemma: rapid growth potential but limited resources. Their next strategic move involved expanding into a new urban neighborhood. However, without any historical data for these untapped markets, the decision was a high-stakes gamble.

A misstep could mean wasted marketing spend, logistical headaches, and a significant dent in their runway. They needed a data-driven framework to select their next market with confidence, all within an aggressive one-week timeline.

The experiment yielded clear, quantifiable results. The top-ranked neighborhood showed significantly lower Cost Per Sign-up and higher intent signals, indicating a much higher likelihood of success.

By launching in the recommended area, UrbanHarvest avoided a potential $50,000 investment in a less viable market. More importantly, they now have a reusable playbook for all future expansion decisions, turning a one-time risk into a long-term asset.
