Constructa Inc., a leader in large-scale commercial construction, relied on manual site inspections to track progress. This process was incredibly time-consuming, requiring teams to spend days on-site with measurement tools, leading to project delays and potential human error.

They needed a way to rapidly compare the 'as-built' reality of their construction sites against the 'as-designed' 3D models (BIM), flagging deviations automatically so project managers could take immediate action.

<hr />

The workflow MVP completely transformed Constructa's QA process. Project managers could now get a detailed progress report within hours of a drone flight, instead of waiting days for a manual survey.

The system caught three critical structural misalignments early, saving an estimated $250,000 in rework costs. The success of the MVP led to a full-scale rollout across all of the company's projects.
