One of the biggest hurdles for any new venture is the unknown. For 'UrbanHarvest,' a D2C grocery startup, the question was existential: which neighborhood should they expand into next? With five potential options but zero historical sales data, making the wrong choice could mean wasting tens of thousands of dollars on a failed launch. This is where rapid, intelligent experimentation comes in.

## The Challenge: Deciding Without Data

Traditional market research is slow and expensive. Surveys can be misleading, and demographic data alone doesn't capture intent. We needed to find a way to measure **actual demand** from real potential customers in each target neighborhood, and we needed to do it in under two weeks.

_Data-driven decisions start with a clear hypothesis._

> The goal wasn't to be 100% certain. The goal was to be 75% confident, which is more than enough to de-risk a major business decision.

## Our Experiment: A Micro-Funnel Approach

We designed a simple, seven-day experiment. We built a micro-funnel combining hyper-local search ads on platforms like Google and Facebook with a simple waitlist landing page. The ads were targeted geographically to each of the five neighborhoods, with messaging tailored to local interests.

1. **Define Success Metrics:** What would a 'successful' neighborhood look like?
2. **Build Micro-Landing Pages:** Simple, focused pages for each neighborhood, capturing interest via a waitlist.
3. **Hyper-Targeted Ad Campaigns:** Utilizing social media and search engines to reach specific geographic areas.
4. **Monitor & Iterate:** Daily tracking of ad performance, sign-ups, and user feedback.
5. **Analyze & Rank:** Comparing results across neighborhoods to identify the strongest contenders.

### Tools We Used

- **Google Ads** for hyper-local search intent
- **Facebook Ads** for broader demographic targeting
- **Mailchimp** for waitlist management
- **Google Analytics** for tracking page performance
- **Custom Python Script** for data aggregation and initial demand modeling

## The Outcome: Data-Backed Confidence

The result was a ranked list of all five neighborhoods, complete with projected CAC and a 75% confidence score. The startup moved forward with the top-ranked area, saving an estimated $50,000 that would have been spent on a launch in the second-worst performing neighborhood. The process became a reusable playbook for future expansion decisions.
