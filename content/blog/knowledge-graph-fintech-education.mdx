**Problem Statement:** Fragmented financial education content across systems hindered the delivery of personalized learning experiences for diverse user segments, including children and homemakers. This slowed user adoption and engagement.

**Impact:** Built side-by-side with our client, a graph-based architecture enabled personalized financial literacy paths, resulting in a 15% uplift in user engagement and demonstrably improved learning outcomes. We achieved this transformation in weeks, not months, validating the approach with a pilot-first strategy.
