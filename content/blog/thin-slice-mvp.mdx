The term 'Minimum Viable Product' has been stretched to its limits. Too often, it becomes an excuse to ship a bloated, feature-incomplete product. We advocate for a different approach: the 'Thin Slice' MVP. The goal is to deliver a complete, end-to-end solution for a single, critical user workflow.

## What is a 'Thin Slice'?

Imagine your product is a multi-layered cake. A traditional MVP might offer a thin layer of the entire cake—a little bit of every feature, but none of it satisfying. A 'Thin Slice' MVP is a full, vertical slice of that cake. It has all the layers—UI, backend, database, automation—but for only one specific task. It's not a demo; it's a real, working tool that solves one problem perfectly.

_A 'Thin Slice' MVP delivers a complete, satisfying experience for one core workflow._

## Finding Your Slice

To find your first slice, map out your user's entire journey. Identify the single most painful, high-friction point. That's your target. By building a complete solution for that one point, you deliver immediate value, generate crucial feedback, and create a solid foundation to build upon. This is how you build momentum and ship products that users love from day one.
