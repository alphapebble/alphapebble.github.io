Start your research post with a strong introductory paragraph. This section should grab the reader's attention and clearly state what the article is about and why it's important. Keep it concise and engaging.

## This is a Main Section Heading (H2)

Use H2 headings to break your content into major logical sections. This improves readability and helps with SEO. Your text goes here, explaining the core concepts of this section. You can use **bold text** to emphasize key points or _italic text_ for nuance.

> This is a blockquote. It's perfect for highlighting a powerful quote, a key takeaway, or an important note for the reader.

You can also include lists to break down information into digestible points.

### This is a Sub-section Heading (H3)

Use H3 headings for topics within a larger H2 section. This creates a clear visual hierarchy.

- This is an unordered list item.
- It's great for things that don't need a specific order.
- You can have as many items as you need.

1.  This is an ordered list item.
2.  Use it for step-by-step instructions or ranked items.
3.  The numbers are handled automatically.

For displaying code, use fenced code blocks with language-specific syntax highlighting.

```javascript
// Example of a JavaScript code block
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("World");
```
