With five potential options but zero historical sales data, making the wrong choice could mean wasting tens of thousands of dollars on a failed launch. This is where rapid, intelligent experimentation comes in.\n\n## The Challenge: Deciding Without Data\n\nTraditional market research is slow and expensive. Surveys can be misleading, and demographic data alone doesn't capture intent. We needed to find a way to measure **actual demand** from real potential customers in each target neighborhood, and we needed to do it in under two weeks.\n\n![A team collaborating around a whiteboard with charts and graphs.](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556742502-ec7c0e9f34b1?auto=format&fit=crop&w=1400&q=80)\n_Data-driven decisions start with a clear hypothesis._\n\n> The goal wasn't to be 100% certain. The goal was to be 75% confident, which is more than enough to de-risk a major business decision.\n\n## Our Experiment: A Micro-Funnel Approach\n\nWe designed a simple, seven-day experiment. We built a micro-funnel combining hyper-local search ads on platforms like Google and Facebook with a simple waitlist landing page. The ads were targeted geographically to each of the five neighborhoods, with messaging tailored to local interests.\n\n1.  **Define Success Metrics:** What would a 'successful' neighborhood look like?\n2.  **Build Micro-Landing Pages:** Simple, focused pages for each neighborhood, capturing interest via a waitlist.\n3.  **Hyper-Targeted Ad Campaigns:** Utilizing social media and search engines to reach specific geographic areas.\n4.  **Monitor & Iterate:** Daily tracking of ad performance, sign-ups, and user feedback.\n5.  **Analyze & Rank:** Comparing results across neighborhoods to identify the strongest contenders.\n\n### Tools We Used\n\n- **Google Ads:** For hyper-local search intent.\n- **Facebook Ads:** For broader demographic targeting.\n- **Mailchimp:** For waitlist management.\n- **Google Analytics:** For tracking page performance.\n- **Custom Python Script:** For data aggregation and initial demand modeling.\n\n## The Outcome: Data-Backed Confidence\n\nThe result was a ranked list of all five neighborhoods, complete with projected CAC and a 75% confidence score. The startup was able to move forward with their expansion into the top-ranked area, saving an estimated $50,000 that would have been spent on a launch in the second-worst performing neighborhood. This entire process provided a reusable outcome—a playbook for all future expansion decisions.\n",
