# Legal Pages Fix Summary

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

The privacy policy and terms of service links were not working due to incorrect URL paths in the footer configuration.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The footer links were pointing to:
- `/privacy-policy` (404 - Not Found)
- `/terms-of-service` (404 - Not Found)

But the actual pages were located at:
- `/legal/privacy-policy` ✅
- `/legal/terms-of-service` ✅

## 🔧 **Fix Applied**

### 1. Updated Site Configuration
**File**: `site.config.ts`

**Before**:
```typescript
links: {
  privacy: "/privacy-policy",
  terms: "/terms-of-service",
}

footer: {
  nav: [
    { title: "Privacy", href: "/privacy-policy" },
    { title: "Terms", href: "/terms-of-service" },
  ]
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
links: {
  privacy: "/legal/privacy-policy",
  terms: "/legal/terms-of-service",
}

footer: {
  nav: [
    { title: "Privacy", href: "/legal/privacy-policy" },
    { title: "Terms", href: "/legal/terms-of-service" },
  ]
}
```
