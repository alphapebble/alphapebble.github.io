# Content Security Policy (CSP) Fix Guide

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

The CSP configuration has been updated to allow Next.js inline scripts that are essential for website functionality.

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### Before (Problematic CSP):
```
script-src-elem 'self' https://calendly.com https://static.cloudflareinsights.com
```

### After (Fixed CSP):
```
script-src-elem 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://calendly.com https://static.cloudflareinsights.com
```

## 📋 **Key Changes Made**

1. **Added `'unsafe-inline'` to `script-src-elem`** - This allows Next.js to execute inline scripts for:
   - Client-side hydration
   - Route prefetching
   - React component initialization
   - Dynamic imports

2. **Maintained Security** - While allowing necessary inline scripts, we still:
   - Restrict script sources to trusted domains
   - Block unsafe-eval for external scripts
   - Maintain XSS protection headers

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### Quick Test
```bash
npm run test:csp
```

### Manual Browser Test
1. Open https://alphapebble.io
2. Open Developer Tools (F12) 
3. Check Console tab - should see NO CSP errors
4. Navigate between pages - should work smoothly

### Expected Results
- ✅ No "Refused to execute inline script" errors
- ✅ Page navigation works properly
- ✅ Interactive elements function correctly
- ✅ No JavaScript errors in console

## 🛡️ **Security Considerations**

While `'unsafe-inline'` is generally discouraged, it's necessary for Next.js applications because:

1. **Next.js Architecture**: Requires inline scripts for hydration and routing
2. **Alternative Solutions**: More complex (nonces, hashes) but not practical for SSR apps
3. **Compensating Controls**: 
   - Strict `default-src 'self'`
   - Limited external script sources
   - XSS protection headers
   - Frame protection

## 🔄 **Future Improvements** (Optional)

If you want to make the CSP stricter in the future, consider:

1. **Nonce-based CSP**: Generate unique nonces for each request
2. **Hash-based CSP**: Pre-calculate hashes for inline scripts
3. **Separate CSP for API routes**: More restrictive CSP for API endpoints

## 📝 **File Changes**

- `csp.config.mjs`: Updated `script-src-elem` directive
- `scripts/test-csp.sh`: Added CSP testing script
- `package.json`: Added `test:csp` command

## 🚀 **Deployment Status**

- ✅ Changes deployed to production
- ✅ CSP headers updated
- ✅ Website functionality restored
- ✅ Security headers maintained
